# Grocery List

A simple implementation of a Grocery List, using React and Redux.

## Getting started

Configuring this repository to get going is extremely simple.

Assuming you already have installed Node and npm (if you don't, [check how to here](https://nodejs.org/en/)), all you'll need to do is:

* Open the terminal in the root folder of the project

* Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

* Once all the dependencies are installed, just run, from the root folder:
```
./node_modules/.bin/gulp
```

* After that, run:
```
./node_modules/.bin/gulp serve
```

This will automatically open your browser in the application, and will also update the application with your changes.

Now you're good to go!
